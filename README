p2nprobe is a simple probe for reading unidirectional ipv4 tcp flows and
sending them using NetFlow v5 format over UDP.

Example usage:
  p2nprobe -h
    Prints help.

  p2nprobe 127.0.0.1:25565 capture.pcap
    Export flows made from packets from the pcap file capture.pcap and send
    them to the address and port 127.0.0.1:25565. This will implicitly use the
    default timeouts of 60 s.

  p2nprobe ipv4.pcap -a 300 localhost:25565
    Export flows made from packets from the pcap file ipv4.pcap and send
    them to the address and port localhost:25565. Set the active timeout to
    300 s and implicitly use the default inactive timeout of 60 s.
